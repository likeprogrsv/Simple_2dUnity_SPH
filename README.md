# Simple_2dUnity_SPH


Using Unity i modelled smooth particle hydrodynamics in 2d. For a basis i took code from khanacademy.org created by Peter Collingridge (@peterwcollingridge).
Also, in my repository "Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics_Unity-ECS" i tried bring it into 3d.

The application is stored in folder "Simple_2D_Unity_Application".

Example of result:
